# Summary

A python-based program that uses OpenAI API (similar to ChatGPT 3) to post tweets on a Twitter account linked to it.
This program generates a start up script using the powerful OpenAI completetion model. Following is an example of the script generated by the ChatGPT system:

🏎️ Zippy - Ride Sharing 
Problem: Lack of transportation options in cities 
Solution: Ride sharing service 
Market: Urban commuters 
Business Model: Platform-based service 
Revenue Model: Per ride fee 
Competitive Advantage: Fast pick-up time and affordable rates
Team: Developers, marketers, and customer service reps 
Funding: Venture capital 
Exit Strategy: Initial public offering or strategic acquisition 

Step 1: Conduct market research to identify best cities to launch
Step 2: Develop platform and integrate with existing payment systems 
Step 3: Develop marketing campaigns targeting commuters 
Step 4: Launch pilot program in select cities and refine the service 
Step 5: Expand service to additional cities 🏙️
Step 6: Expand fleet to meet demand 🚗 
Step 7: Monitor customer feedback and refine service 📝 
Step 8: Create partnerships with third-party businesses 🤝 
Step 9: Develop loyalty program to retain customers 🎁 
Step 10: Offer incentives to recruit drivers 💰

Then this program partitions this long script! into few threads just like shown in the image below:

# Instructions

Clone this git repository into your local machine using the ```git clone``` command as shown below:

```
git clone https://github.com/samadley/startupscript
```

After cloning, change directory into the project folder:

```
cd startupscript
```

Then, run the following command to install the dependencies (```openai``` and ```tweepy```), make sure you have ```pip``` installed on your machine:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Important! (Getting your OpenAI and Twitter Developer API keys)

Next up, you need to:
1. Setup your OpenAI API key -> ([Sign up for free and get your API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
2. Get your Twitter Developer API key and secret and also consumer API key and secret -> [Open this link and sign up and copy the required API keys and secrets](https://developer.twitter.com/apps)
When you are doing step 2, paste the obtained API keys and secrets into a ```startup.json``` file in the main directory of the project. Use the below image for clarifications:

![A screenshot of what your ```json``` file should contain](https://github.com/samadley/startupscript/blob/master/resources/credentials_json.png)

After getting your API keys and creating the ```json``` file, you're all set! Run the main program script( ```main.py``` )by typing below command into your terminal:

```
python3 main.py
```


# TODO 

1. Make the tweet series have numbers at their beginning so users can easily open and use the series. [DONE]
2. Wrap the Startup code in a class instead of putting them in the main.py. [DONE]
3. Neat up the code and write a more comprehensive test suite. 
4. Implement the timer feature so the bot posts at pre-determined intervals. [DONE]
5. Dockerize this thing so you don't have to repeat so many steps to get started on each instance.
6. Implement a feature to follow and unfollow users automatically to grow the page follower count.
7. Implement a feature to comment on posts related to startups.
8. Refactor code so you make sure that class, function and variable names follow the Python naming convention.
