1. Make the tweet series have numbers at their beginning so users can easily open and use the series. [DONE]
2. Wrap the Startup code in a class instead of putting them in the main.py. 
3. Neat up the code and write a more comprehensive test suite. 
4. Implement the timer feature so the bot posts at pre-determined intervals. [DONE]

6. Implement a feature to follow and unfollow users automatically to grow the page follower count.
7. Implement a feature to comment on posts related to startups.
